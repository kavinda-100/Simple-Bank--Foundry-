   ```bash
   export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
   export PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
   make deploy-sepolia
   ```

3. **Deploy to Goerli Testnet**:

   ```bash
   export GOERLI_RPC_URL="https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
   export PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
   make deploy-goerli
   ```

### Mainnet Deployment

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Mainnet deployment costs real ETH!

```bash
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY"
export PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
make deploy-mainnet
```

## üîç Contract Interaction Commands

### Check Balances

```bash
# Check ETH balance of an address
make balance ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

### Call Contract Functions

```bash
# Call a read-only function
make call CONTRACT=0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS FUNCTION="getBalance(address)" ARGS=0xUSER_ADDRESS

# Example: Check bank balance
make call CONTRACT=0xYourBankContract FUNCTION="getBalance(address)" ARGS=0xUserAddress
```

### Send Transactions

```bash
# Send a transaction
make send CONTRACT=0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS FUNCTION="deposit()" PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_KEY

# Send ETH to an address
make send-eth TO=0xRECIPIENT_ADDRESS AMOUNT=1ether PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_KEY
```

## üìä Analysis Commands

### Gas Analysis

```bash
# Generate gas snapshot
make snapshot

# Compare gas changes
make snapshot-diff
```

### Contract Analysis

```bash
# View storage layout
make storage

# Get contract ABI
make abi-bank
make abi-account
```

## üîß Utility Commands

### Development Tools

```bash
# Start Anvil with custom settings
make anvil-custom

# Format code and check formatting
make format
make format-check

# Generate documentation
make docs
```

## üìù Environment Variables

### Required for Testnet/Mainnet

```bash
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
GOERLI_RPC_URL=https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Optional for Interaction

```bash
CONTRACT=0xCONTRACT_ADDRESS
FUNCTION="functionName()"
ARGS=argument_value
ADDRESS=0xADDRESS_TO_CHECK
TO=0xRECIPIENT_ADDRESS
AMOUNT=1ether
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Private Key Management

- **Never** commit real private keys to version control
- Use different keys for different networks
- Keep mainnet keys extra secure
- Consider hardware wallets for mainnet

### Testing Before Deployment

1. Test on local network first: `make deploy-local`
2. Test on testnet: `make deploy-sepolia`
3. Run full test suite: `make test`
4. Check gas usage: `make test-gas`
5. Only then consider mainnet deployment

### Verification

Always verify your contracts after deployment:

```bash
# Verification is included in deployment commands
make deploy-sepolia  # Includes verification
```

## üèõÔ∏è Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete workflow from development to deployment:

### 1. Development Phase

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run tests during development
make test-v

# Check specific functionality
make test-bank
make test-fuzz

# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# Format code
make format
```

### 2. Local Testing

```bash
# Start local network
make anvil

# Deploy locally (in another terminal)
make deploy-local

# Interact with local deployment
make balance ADDRESS=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
```

### 3. Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your testnet RPC and private key

# Deploy to testnet
make deploy-sepolia

# Test on testnet
make balance ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContract
```

### 4. Mainnet Deployment (when ready)

```bash
# Final checks
make test
make snapshot

# Deploy to mainnet (be careful!)
make deploy-mainnet
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused" error**:
   - Make sure Anvil is running: `make anvil`
   - Check if the RPC URL is correct

2. **"Insufficient funds" error**:
   - Make sure your address has enough ETH
   - For testnet, get ETH from faucets

3. **"Invalid private key" error**:
   - Make sure private key starts with `0x`
   - Verify the private key is correct

4. **"Contract not found" error**:
   - Make sure contract is deployed
   - Verify the contract address is correct

### Getting Help

- Run `make help` to see all available commands
- Check the `.env.example` file for environment setup
- Review test output for detailed error messages
